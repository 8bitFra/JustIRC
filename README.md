# Just IRC

Just IRC is a fabric mod that allows you to connect to an irc server in minecraft chat.

This is my very first mod I create, so it kinda sucks. I hope to improve it over time!

## Usage
- The mod is very simple, and everything you need to know can be found in the game via the command "#help" or "#h"

### Tested on irc.freenode.net and a local server created with InspIRCd

### Known issues
 - After a period of inactivity, the mod disconnects from the channel
 - Entering a wrong ip in some cases can cause the client to crash
 - Player death causes data loss
