# Just IRC

Just IRC is a fabric mod that allows you to connect to an irc server in minecraft chat.

This is my very first mod I create, so it kinda sucks. I hope to improve it over time!

## Usage
- The mod is very simple, and everything you need to know can be found in the game via the command "@help" or "@h"

### Tested on irc.freenode.net and a local server created with InspIRCd

### Useful informations
If you can't connect to the irc channel, make sure no one has already joined with your minecraft name.

If you have a Minecraft name that start with a number, if you can't connect to the irc server, make sure that you haven't used illegal characters on your irc nickname. (currently in this case the mod has no checks)

### Known issues
 - <s>After a period of inactivity, the mod disconnects from the channel</s>
 - <s>Entering a wrong ip in some cases can cause the client to crash</s>
 - <s>Player death causes data loss</s>
